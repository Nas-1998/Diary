This is version 1 of the Diary app.
Currently it only has 1 user.

The application allows the user to select from the home page whether they would like to view their diary post or create a new post.
In the searchView page they will be able to search by id, date or category and then their results can be viewed on the same page.
on the same page they will also have the option to delete or update an existing post by entering the id after the selecting the option.
If the user decides to update an existing post they will be taken to the update page which has a simialr format to the create page that will be explained below.
In the create page the user will be able to add a new post to their diary by writing a new post and also adding the date in which they wrote it.
The view page will allow for retrival of data from the database.

The navbar at the top of all the pages will give the user the option to be guided back ot the home page.
